- **Definition**: An instance of a class, representing a specific data structure in memory that can have attributes and methods defined by its class.

### **13. Inheritance**
- **Definition**: A feature of OOP (Object-Oriented Programming) where a new class (child) derives attributes and methods from an existing class (parent), promoting code reuse.

### **14. Polymorphism**
- **Definition**: The ability to present the same interface for different data types, allowing functions to operate on objects of different classes.

### **15. Encapsulation**
- **Definition**: The bundling of data and methods that operate on the data within a class, restricting direct access to some of the object's components.

### **16. Abstraction**
- **Definition**: The concept of hiding the complex implementation details of a class or function and showing only the essential features.

### **17. Module**
- **Definition**: A file containing Python definitions and statements that can be imported and used in other Python programs.

### **18. Package**
- **Definition**: A collection of Python modules grouped together under a common directory, usually with an `__init__.py` file to indicate it is a package.

### **19. Import Statement**
- **Definition**: A statement used to include a module or specific attributes from a module into the current namespace, allowing access to its functions and classes.

### **20. Exception Handling**
- **Definition**: The process of responding to the occurrence of exceptions—unexpected events during program execution—using `try`, `except`, `finally`, and `else` blocks.

### **21. Try-Except Block**
- **Definition**: A control flow construct used to handle exceptions in Python, where the code that might throw an exception is placed inside the `try` block and the error-handling code inside the `except` block.

### **22. Python List**
- **Definition**: A mutable, ordered collection of items in Python, defined using square brackets, that can hold mixed data types.

### **23. Python Tuple**
- **Definition**: An immutable, ordered collection of items in Python, defined using parentheses, often used to store related pieces of information.

### **24. Python Dictionary**
- **Definition**: An unordered collection of key-value pairs in Python, defined using curly braces, where each key is unique.

### **25. Set**
- **Definition**: An unordered collection of unique items in Python, defined using curly braces or the `set()` function, often used for membership testing and eliminating duplicates.

### **26. List Slicing**
- **Definition**: A technique for extracting a subset of elements from a list, tuple, or string using the `:` operator.

### **27. Iterators**
- **Definition**: Objects in Python that implement the iterator protocol, consisting of the `__iter__()` and `__next__()` methods, used to iterate over iterable objects like lists.

### **28. Iterable**
- **Definition**: An object capable of returning its members one at a time, allowing it to be looped over in a `for` loop, including lists, tuples, and dictionaries.

### **29. Mutable vs Immutable**
- **Definition**: Mutable objects (like lists and dictionaries) can be modified after creation, while immutable objects (like tuples and strings) cannot be changed.

### **30. Global Variable**
- **Definition**: A variable declared outside of any function, available throughout the entire program, and can be accessed and modified anywhere in the code.

### **31. Local Variable**
- **Definition**: A variable declared within a function, accessible only within that function’s scope, not affecting other parts of the program.

### **32. List Methods**
- **Definition**: Built-in functions available for Python lists, such as `append()`, `remove()`, and `sort()`, which allow manipulation of list data.

### **33. String Methods**
- **Definition**: Built-in functions for string manipulation in Python, such as `split()`, `join()`, and `replace()`, providing extensive functionality for working with text.

### **34. Dictionary Methods**
- **Definition**: Built-in functions for Python dictionaries, like `keys()`, `values()`, and `items()`, which allow access and manipulation of key-value pairs.

### **35. Comprehension**
- **Definition**: A compact syntax for generating lists, dictionaries, or sets by iterating over an iterable and optionally including a condition.

### **36. Map Function**
- **Definition**: A built-in function that applies a given function to all items of an iterable, returning a map object (which is an iterator).

### **37. Filter Function**
- **Definition**: A built-in function that constructs an iterator from elements of an iterable for which a function returns true.

### **38. Reduce Function**
- **Definition**: A function that applies a binary function to the items of an iterable cumulatively to reduce the iterable to a single value, available through the `functools` module.

### **39. Lambda Expression**
- **Definition**: A small anonymous function defined using the `lambda` keyword, often used as an argument to higher-order functions like `map()` and `filter()`.

### **40. Python REPL**
- **Definition**: Stands for "Read-Eval-Print Loop," an interactive Python shell that reads user input, evaluates it, and prints the result, providing an environment for quick testing and debugging.

### **41. F-Strings**
- **Definition**: A way to format strings in Python, introduced in version 3.6, using curly braces `{}` to evaluate expressions directly within string literals.

### **42. List Iteration**
- **Definition**: The process of looping over elements in a list, typically done using a `for` loop to access each item sequentially.

### **43. Python `range()`**
- **Definition**: A built-in function that generates a sequence of numbers, often used for looping a specific number of times in a `for` loop.

### **44. List `append()`**
- **Definition**: A method that adds an item to the end of a list, modifying the list in place.

### **45. List `extend()`**
- **Definition**: A method that adds all elements from an iterable (e.g., list, tuple) to the end of the list, extending it.

### **46. List `pop()`**
- **Definition**: A method that removes and returns the item at a given index (or the last item if no index is specified) from a list.

### **47. Python `zip()`**
- **Definition**: A function that combines elements from two or more iterables (e.g., lists, tuples) into tuples, creating a zip object, often used to pair elements.

### **48. Python `enumerate()`**
- **Definition**: A built-in function that adds a counter to an iterable and returns it as an enumerate object, often used in loops to get both index and value.

### **49. Python `__init__` Method**
- **Definition**: A special method in Python classes that initializes a new instance of the class, often referred to as the constructor.

### **50. Python `__str__` Method**
- **Definition**: A special method in Python classes that returns a string representation of an object, making it easier to read and debug.

### **51. Python `with` Statement**
- **Definition**: A control flow statement that simplifies exception handling by encapsulating common preparation and cleanup tasks in context managers.

This list covers essential concepts, features, and functions in Python programming, which are crucial for understanding and working with the language, especially in the context of data science.
