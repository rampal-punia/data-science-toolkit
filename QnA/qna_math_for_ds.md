## Linear Algebra

### Question: Matrix Operations and Applications:

Explain the role of matrices in data science. How are matrix operations (e.g., multiplication, inversion) used in machine learning algorithms?

### Question: Eigenvalues and Eigenvectors:

What are eigenvalues and eigenvectors? How are they relevant in dimensionality reduction techniques like PCA (Principal Component Analysis) and spectral clustering?

### Question: Singular Value Decomposition (SVD):

Describe the concept of SVD. How is SVD used for feature extraction, image compression, and collaborative filtering in recommendation systems?

### Question: Matrix Factorization Techniques:

Discuss matrix factorization methods such as LU decomposition and QR decomposition. How are these techniques applied in solving systems of linear equations and optimizing algorithms?

### Question: Vector Spaces and Subspaces:

Define vector spaces and subspaces. How do they relate to the concept of linear independence and basis vectors in data representation?

### Question: Orthogonality and Projections:

What is orthogonality in the context of vectors and matrices? How are orthogonal projections used in regression analysis and error minimization?

## Statistics

### Question: Descriptive vs. Inferential Statistics:

Differentiate between descriptive and inferential statistics. How do these branches of statistics contribute to data analysis and decision-making?

### Question: Probability Distributions:

Name and describe common probability distributions (e.g., normal, binomial, Poisson). When would you use each distribution in statistical modeling?

### Question: Hypothesis Testing:

Explain the process of hypothesis testing. What are Type I and Type II errors? Provide examples of hypothesis tests used in A/B testing and quality control.

### Question: Confidence Intervals:

Define confidence intervals. How do you interpret a 95% confidence interval in statistical analysis? What factors affect the width of a confidence interval?

### Question: Statistical Sampling Techniques:

Discuss different sampling techniques (e.g., random sampling, stratified sampling). How do you choose an appropriate sampling method for collecting data?

### Question: Correlation vs. Causation:

Explain the difference between correlation and causation. Why is establishing causality challenging in observational studies and data-driven research?

## Calculus

### Question: Derivatives and Gradients:

What are derivatives and gradients in calculus? How are they used in optimizing machine learning models (e.g., gradient descent)?

### Question: Chain Rule and Multivariate Calculus:

Describe the chain rule in calculus. How does multivariate calculus (e.g., partial derivatives) apply to optimization problems in data science?

### Question: Integral Calculus:

Define integral calculus and its applications in data analysis. How is integration used in calculating areas under curves and expected values in probability?
