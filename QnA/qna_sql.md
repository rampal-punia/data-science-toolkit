## SQL (Structured Query Language) Questions

### Question:Introduction to SQL:

What is SQL, and why is it important in data science? Explain the difference between SQL and NoSQL databases. How do SQL databases ensure data integrity and consistency?

### Question:SQL Syntax and Queries:

Describe the basic structure of an SQL query. How do you retrieve data from a single table using SELECT statements? Provide examples of filtering, sorting, and limiting results.

### Question: Joins and Relationships:

Explain different types of SQL joins (e.g., INNER JOIN, LEFT JOIN, RIGHT JOIN). When and how do you use each type to combine data from multiple tables?

### Question: Aggregation Functions:

What are SQL aggregation functions (e.g., SUM, AVG, COUNT, MAX, MIN)? How do you use these functions to calculate summary statistics and perform data summarization?

### Question: Subqueries and Nested Queries:

Define subqueries and nested queries in SQL. How are they used to break down complex queries and retrieve specific subsets of data?
Advanced SQL Concepts

### Question: Window Functions:

Explain window functions in SQL (e.g., ROW_NUMBER, RANK, LAG, LEAD). How do you use window functions for ranking, partitioning data, and calculating moving averages?

### Question: Common Table Expressions (CTEs):

What are Common Table Expressions (CTEs), and how do they improve query readability and maintainability? Provide examples of recursive and non-recursive CTEs.

### Question: Indexes and Query Optimization:

Discuss the importance of indexes in SQL databases. How do you create and use indexes to optimize query performance? What factors influence index selection?

### Question: Transaction Management:

Define transactions in SQL. How do you ensure ACID (Atomicity, Consistency, Isolation, Durability) properties in database transactions? Explain the use of COMMIT, ROLLBACK, and SAVEPOINT statements.

### Question: Handling NULL Values:

How does SQL handle NULL values, and why are they important to consider in data analysis? Describe techniques for handling NULL values in queries and data manipulation.

### Question: Data Modification:

Explain SQL statements for data modification (e.g., INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE). What precautions should you take to avoid unintended data modifications and ensure data integrity?

## SQL in Data Analysis and Reporting

### Question: Data Filtering and Cleaning:

How do you filter and clean data using SQL queries? Provide examples of techniques for removing duplicates, handling missing values, and converting data types.

### Question: Grouping and Aggregating Data:

Describe how GROUP BY and HAVING clauses work in SQL. How are they used for grouping data into subsets and applying aggregate functions?

### Question: Time Series Analysis with SQL:

How do you perform time-based analysis using SQL? Explain techniques for calculating rolling averages, cumulative sums, and month-over-month comparisons.

### Question: Pivoting and Unpivoting Data:

What is data pivoting in SQL? How do you transform rows into columns (pivoting) and columns into rows (unpivoting) to reshape data for analysis?

### Question: Analytical Functions in SQL:

Discuss the use of analytical functions (e.g., LEAD, LAG, FIRST_VALUE, LAST_VALUE) in SQL. How are these functions applied to perform complex calculations and trend analysis?

## SQL Optimization and Best Practices
### Question: Query Performance Tuning:

How do you identify and optimize slow-performing SQL queries? Describe strategies such as query rewriting, using indexes, and analyzing query execution plans.

### Question: Normalization and Database Design:

Explain the principles of database normalization (e.g., 1NF, 2NF, 3NF). Why is normalization important in database design, and how does it improve data integrity and efficiency?

### Question: Database Constraints:

What are database constraints (e.g., PRIMARY KEY, FOREIGN KEY, UNIQUE constraint)? How do constraints enforce data integrity rules and prevent inconsistent data?

### Question: Stored Procedures and Functions:

Define stored procedures and functions in SQL. How do you create and use them to encapsulate business logic, improve code reusability, and enhance database security?

### Question: Data Warehousing and OLAP:

Explain the role of SQL in data warehousing and Online Analytical Processing (OLAP). How do you design and query multidimensional databases for complex analytical queries?
