## Time Series Analysis

1. **Time Series**: A sequence of data points collected or recorded at specific time intervals, often used to analyze trends, patterns, and forecasting.

2. **Seasonality**: A repeating pattern or fluctuation in a time series that occurs at regular intervals, such as daily, monthly, or yearly.

3. **Trend**: The long-term movement or direction in a time series, indicating an overall increase, decrease, or stability over time.

4. **Stationarity**: A property of a time series where its statistical properties (mean, variance, autocorrelation) are constant over time.

5. **Autocorrelation**: The correlation of a time series with its own past values, indicating how past data points are related to current values.

6. **Partial Autocorrelation**: The correlation between a time series and its lagged values, controlling for the values at intervening lags.

7. **Lag**: The time difference between observations in a time series, often used in autocorrelation and moving average calculations.

8. **Moving Average (MA)**: A technique used to smooth time series data by averaging adjacent observations over a specified number of periods.

9. **Exponential Smoothing**: A forecasting technique that applies exponentially decreasing weights to past observations, giving more importance to recent data.

10. **Holt-Winters Method**: A time series forecasting method that accounts for seasonality, trend, and level, using exponential smoothing.

22. **Unit Root**: A characteristic of a time series that indicates non-stationarity, where shocks have a permanent effect on the level of the series.

23. **Dickey-Fuller Test**: A statistical test used to determine whether a time series has a unit root and is therefore non-stationary.

25. **Cointegration**: A statistical property of a set of time series where a linear combination of them is stationary, despite each being non-stationary.

26. **Granger Causality**: A statistical hypothesis test used to determine whether one time series can predict another.

27. **Impulse Response Function (IRF)**: A function that describes the response of a time series to a shock or impulse in another series or in its own past.

28. **Vector Autoregression (VAR)**: A multivariate time series model where each variable is modeled as a linear function of its own past values and the past values of other variables.

29. **Vector Error Correction Model (VECM)**: A multivariate time series model used when variables are cointegrated, capturing both short-term dynamics and long-term relationships.

30. **Seasonal Adjustment**: The process of removing seasonal effects from a time series to analyze underlying trends and cycles.

31. **Spectral Analysis**: A method used to examine the frequency components of a time series, often using Fourier transforms.

32. **Fourier Transform**: A mathematical transform used to decompose a time series into its frequency components.

33. **Periodogram**: A graphical representation of the frequency spectrum of a time series, showing the strength of different frequency components.

34. **Autoregressive Integrated Moving Average (ARIMA) with Exogenous Variables (ARIMAX)**: An ARIMA model that includes external variables to improve forecasting accuracy.

35. **Prophet**: A time series forecasting tool developed by Facebook that is robust to missing data and handles seasonality and holidays.

36. **Exogenous Variables**: External variables that influence a time series but are not influenced by it, often included in models to improve accuracy.

37. **Kalman Filter**: An algorithm that provides estimates of unknown variables in a time series, particularly useful for handling noise and missing data.

38. **State Space Model**: A mathematical model that represents a time series as a set of hidden states, often used in conjunction with the Kalman filter.

39. **Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE)**: A method used to estimate the parameters of a time series model by maximizing the likelihood function.

40. **Akaike Information Criterion (AIC)**: A metric used to compare the goodness-of-fit of different time series models, penalizing model complexity.

41. **Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC)**: Similar to AIC, but with a stronger penalty for model complexity, often used for model selection.

42. **Out-of-Sample Forecasting**: The process of evaluating a time series model's performance by making predictions on data not used in model fitting.

43. **Backtesting**: The process of testing a time series forecasting model on historical data to assess its accuracy and robustness.

44. **Ensemble Forecasting**: Combining multiple time series models to improve forecasting accuracy by averaging their predictions.

45. **Rolling Forecast Origin**: A forecasting method where the origin of the forecast is continuously rolled forward, allowing for ongoing model evaluation.

46. **Sliding Window**: A method used to analyze a subset of a time series over a moving window of fixed size, often used in rolling forecasts.
