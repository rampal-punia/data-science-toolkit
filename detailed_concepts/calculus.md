## Calculus

### Function
- A relation that assigns exactly one output to each input, often represented as f(x).

### Derivative
- A measure of how a function changes as its input changes, representing the slope of the function at a point.

### Partial Derivative
- The derivative of a multivariable function with respect to one variable while keeping others constant.

### Gradient
- A vector of partial derivatives that points in the direction of the steepest increase of a function.

### Hessian Matrix
- A square matrix of second-order partial derivatives of a scalar-valued function, used to analyze curvature.

### Jacobian Matrix
- A matrix of first-order partial derivatives of a vector-valued function, representing the best linear approximation near a point.

### Chain Rule
- A rule for computing the derivative of a composite function, expressing the derivative as the product of the derivatives of the composed functions.

### Integral
- A mathematical operation that represents the accumulation of quantities, such as areas under a curve.

### Definite Integral
- An integral with specified upper and lower limits, representing the net area under a curve.

### Indefinite Integral
- An integral without specified limits, representing a family of functions differing by a constant.

### Fundamental Theorem of Calculus
- A theorem linking differentiation and integration, stating that differentiation and integration are inverse operations.

### Taylor Series
- An infinite series of terms used to approximate a function near a point, based on its derivatives at that point.

### Maclaurin Series
- A special case of the Taylor series, where the expansion is around zero.

### Gradient Descent
- An optimization algorithm that iteratively moves towards the minimum of a function by following the negative gradient.

### Laplacian
- A differential operator that calculates the divergence of the gradient of a scalar field, used in fields such as image processing.

### Divergence
- A measure of the magnitude of a vector fieldâ€™s source or sink at a given point, representing the rate of change of density.

### Curl
- A measure of the rotation of a vector field, representing the circulation density at a point.

### Level Set
- A curve or surface representing points where a function takes a constant value, often used in optimization.

### Critical Point
- A point on a function where the gradient is zero, indicating a potential maximum, minimum, or saddle point.

### Saddle Point
- A critical point where the function is neither a maximum nor a minimum, but has a slope that changes direction.

### Convex Function
- A function where the line segment between any two points on the graph lies above or on the graph, indicating a single global minimum.

### Concave Function
- A function where the line segment between any two points on the graph lies below or on the graph, indicating a single global maximum.

### Lagrange Multiplier
- A method for finding the local maxima and minima of a function subject to equality constraints.

### Directional Derivative
- The rate at which a function changes in the direction of a given vector, generalizing the concept of a gradient.

### Implicit Differentiation
- A technique to find the derivative of a function defined implicitly by an equation, rather than explicitly.
