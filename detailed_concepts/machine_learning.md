34. **One-Hot Encoding**: A method for representing categorical variables as binary vectors, where each category is represented by a unique vector with a single high value.

35. **Confusion Matrix**: A table used to evaluate the performance of a classification model, showing the true positives, false positives, true negatives, and false negatives.

36. **Precision**: The ratio of true positives to the sum of true positives and false positives, measuring the accuracy of positive predictions.
